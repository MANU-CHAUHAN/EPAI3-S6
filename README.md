# S6

Part 1:
---------
1. Write a single expression that includes lambda, zip and map functions to select create 52 cards in a deck 
2. Write a normal function without using lambda, zip, and map function to create 52 cards in a deck 
3. Write a function that, when given 2 sets of 3 or 4 or 5 cards (1 game can only have 3 cards with each player or 4 cards or 5 cards per player) (1 deck of cards only), (2 players only), can identify who won the game of poker 

Given:
vals = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'jack', 'queen', 'king', 'ace']
suits = ['spades', 'clubs', 'hearts', 'diamonds']

## Functions

### 1. create_deck_cards_lambda 

This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits using lambda and map function in a single line

    def create_cards_lambda() -> list:
        """
        Creates 52 cards in a deck, with help of lambda, map, zip and list comprehension,
        all in a single expression
        :return: list of `tuples` containing card combinations
        """

### 2. create_deck_cards_normal_function

This function creates all 52 cards from vals and suits without using lambda and map function

    def create_deck_cards_normal_function() -> list:
        """
        Creates 52 cards in a deck via a simpler approach
        :return: list of tuples containing card combinations
        """

## Rules for Poker:

#### Royal Flush : 

A, K, Q, J, 10, all the same suit for 5 cards.

#### Straight flush :

Cards in a sequence, all in the same suit.

#### Four of a kind :

Four cards of the same rank.
This is not applicable to set of 3 cards.

#### Full house :

#### Straight :

#### Two pair :

Two different pairs.

Two cards of the same rank.

#### High Card :

When you havenâ€™t made any of the hands above, the highest card from both set is compared.
